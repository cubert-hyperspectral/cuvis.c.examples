## Building the examples
To get the exampels running, first set up a project directory, clone this git repository and initialize its submodule(s).

```
git submodule update --init
```

Then, you need to install the Cuvis C SDK (see [here](https://cloud.cubert-gmbh.de/index.php/s/m1WfR66TjcGl96z)), as explained for the C landing page [here](https://github.com/cubert-hyperspectral/cuvis.c).

Then use CMake (see https://cmake.org/download/) to configure and generate the Visual Studio project. You can configure either base directory (including all directoreis) or a single example using its respective directory.
CMake will require you to locate the Cuvis C SDK (this should be found automatically, if the Cuvis C SDK is properly installed). 

For running some of the examples, you have to use sample data (provided [here](https://cloud.cubert-gmbh.de/index.php/s/3oECVGWpC1NpNqC)).

## Inventory

### 01_loadMeasurement
Load measurement from disk and print the value (count) for all available channels (wavelength) for one specific pixel.

### 02_reprocessMeasurement
Load measurement as well as references (dark, white, distance) from disk and reprocess the measurement to reflectance.

### 03_exportMeasurement
Load measurement from disk and save to different file formats.

### 04_changeDistance
Load measurement from disk and reprocess to a new given distance.

### 05_recordSingleImages
Setup camera and record measurements via looping software trigger, aka 
"single shot mode" or "software mode".

### 06_recordVideo
Setup camera and record measurements via internal clock triggering, aka "video mode". In this example the `cuvis.Worker` is used to make use of multithreading (`cuvis_worker_create`).

### 07_recordVideoFromSessionFile
Set up a virtual camera based on a pre-recorded session file to simulate actual camera behaviour.
